The task:
An educator compares test scores between two teaching methods: in-person (scores: [75, 80, 78, 82, 79]) and online (scores: [85, 88, 84, 90, 87]). 
The means are 78.8 and 86.8, respectively, and the standard deviations are 2.59 and 2.17. Perform a two-sample t-test to test the hypothesis that
the average scores differ between the methods (use a significance level of 0.05). State the null hypothesis (H₀: μ₁ = μ₂) 
and alternative hypothesis (H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂), calculate the t-statistic using the formula t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂) / √(s₁²/n₁ + s₂²/n₂), 
and compare it to the critical t-value of 2.306 (for a two-tailed test with 8 degrees of freedom). Interpret the results.

Two-Sample t-Test (Independent Samples)

Null hypothesis: mu1 = mu2
Alternative hypothesis: mu1 ≠ mu2

Means:
x1 = 78.8
x2 = 86.8

Standard deviations:
s1 = 2.59
s2 = 2.17

Sample sizes:
n1 = 5
n2 = 5

Compute numerator:
x1 - x2 = -8.0

Compute denominator:
s1^2 = 6.7081
s2^2 = 4.7089
s1^2 / n1 = 1.34162
s2^2 / n2 = 0.94178
Sum = 2.28340
Square root = 1.51109

t statistic:
t = -8.0 / 1.51109 = -5.29418
Absolute value = 5.29418

Critical value (two-tailed, alpha = 0.05, df = 8):
t_crit = 2.306

Decision:
Since 5.29418 > 2.306, reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion:
There is a statistically significant difference between the average scores of the two teaching methods.
The online method shows higher scores.
